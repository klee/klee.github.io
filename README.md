# KLEE Official Website

The KLEE website, built using [Web Starter Kit](http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Quickstart

### Dependencies

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) â‰¥ 2.0.0.  You can use [RVM](http://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to install it. (A Ruby DevKit is required to build dependencies with native extensions.)

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

* [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).  You can use `gem install bundle` to install it.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)


### Installation

Clone this repository and install all dependencies using:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Then, you can preview the site by running (at `localhost:4000` by default):

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```

To build the site, you can use:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```

## Contributing

Contributions, both to content and design are welcome and encouraged. To contribute, please submit a pull request.

## Adding Release Documentation

The repository has old versions of the documentation in `releases/docs/`. To generate documentation for a new release, do the following:

1. Open `_config.yml` and
 - Change `is_release` to `true`
 - Add the `releases` folder to `exclude`
 - Set `current_version` to the new KLEE version

2. Run the following command, where `<VERSION>` is the KLEE version:

```
$ jekyll build -d releases/docs/<VERSION> --baseurl /releases/docs/<VERSION>
```

3. Clear the changes made to `_config.yml` (e.g. by doing `git reset --hard`)
4. Add `releases/docs/<VERSION>` to the repository
5. Add an entry for the release in `releases/index.md`
6. Commit the changes
