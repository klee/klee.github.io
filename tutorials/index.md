We also recommend the following external resources.  When using them, please take into account that they might be using old versions of KLEE. 

1. [Symbolic execution with KLEE](https://adalogics.com/blog/symbolic-execution-with-klee): A set of four instructional videos introducing KLEE, starting with how to get started with KLEE and ending with a demo that finds memory corruption bugs in real code.
1. [Solving a maze with KLEE](http://feliam.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/the-symbolic-maze/): A nice explanation of how symbolic execution can be used to generate interesting program inputs. The example shows how to use KLEE to find all the solutions to a maze game.
