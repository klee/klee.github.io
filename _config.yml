# This variable controls changes the behaviour of the banner in

# for a release this should be set to true.
is_release: false

# When doing a release make sure you exclude the releases folder by replacing
# the `exclude` declaration with the version that is currently commented out.
#
# It would be nice if we could just do the right thing if `is_release` is set to
# `true` but we can't do this in YAML.
