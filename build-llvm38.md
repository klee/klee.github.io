The current procedure for building KLEE with LLVM 3.8 is outlined below. 

1. **Install dependencies:** KLEE requires all the dependencies of LLVM, which are discussed [here](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements). In particular, you should install the following programs and libraries, listed below as Ubuntu packages:  

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential curl libcap-dev git cmake libncurses5-dev python-minimal python-pip unzip libtcmalloc-minimal4 libgoogle-perftools-dev libsqlite3-dev doxygen
   $ pip3 install tabulate
   ```

2. **Install LLVM 3.8:** KLEE is built on top of [LLVM](http://llvm.org); the first steps are to get a working LLVM installation. See [Getting Started with the LLVM System](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) for more information.

   **NOTE:** KLEE is currently tested on **Linux x86-64**, and might break on x86-32.

   If you are using a recent Ubuntu (e.g. 16.04 LTS) or Debian, we recommend you to use the LLVM packages provided by LLVM itself. 


   ```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install clang-3.8 llvm-3.8 llvm-3.8-dev llvm-3.8-tools  
   ```

   That's it for LLVM. If you want to install it manually, please refer to the official [LLVM Getting Started documentation](http://releases.llvm.org/3.8.0/docs/GettingStarted.html).

3. **Install constraint solver(s)**

   KLEE supports multiple different constraint solvers. You must install at least one to build KLEE.

   * [STP](https://github.com/stp/stp) Historically KLEE was built around STP so support for this solver is the most stable. For build instructions, see [here]({{site.baseurl}}/build-stp).
   * [Z3](https://github.com/z3prover/z3) is a more recent addition to KLEE but is reasonably stable. You should use Z3 version â‰¥ 4.4. For build instructions, see [here](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/README.md).
   * [metaSMT](https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/metaSMT) supports
     various solvers, including Boolector, STP and Z3.  We recommend branch v4.rc1 (`git clone -b v4.rc1 ...`). For build instructions, see [here](https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/metaSMT).

4. **(Optional) Build uclibc and the POSIX environment model:** By default, KLEE works on closed programs (programs that don't use any external code such as C library functions). However, if you want to use KLEE to run real programs you will want to enable the KLEE POSIX runtime, which is built on top of the [uClibc](http://uclibc.org) C library.

   **To build klee-uclibc run:**

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/klee/klee-uclibc.git  
   $ cd klee-uclibc  
   $ ./configure --make-llvm-lib  
   $ make -j2  
   $ cd .. 
   ```
   When `clang` or `llvm-config` are not in your `PATH` or have a custom prefix/suffix, `configure` may fail to detect their location. You can use the `--with-cc` and `--with-llvm-config` flags to set the paths manually.

   **NOTE:** If you are on a different target (i.e., not i386 or x64), you will need to run make config and select the correct target. The defaults for the other uClibc configuration variables should be fine.  <br/><br/>  

   To tell KLEE to use klee-uclibc and use the POSIX runtime pass
   `-DENABLE_POSIX_RUNTIME=ON` and `-DKLEE_UCLIBC_PATH=<KLEE_UCLIBC_SOURCE_DIR>`
   to CMake when configuring KLEE in step 8 where `<KLEE_UCLIBC_SOURCE_DIR>` is
   the absolute path to the cloned `klee-uclibc` git repository.<br/><br/>  

5. **(Optional) Get Google test sources:**

   For unit tests we use the Google test libraries. If you don't want to run the unit tests you can skip this step but you will
   need to pass `-DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=OFF` to CMake when configuring KLEE in step 8.

   We depend on a version `1.7.0` right now so grab the sources for it.

   ```bash
   $ curl -OL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.7.0.zip
   $ unzip release-1.7.0.zip
   ```

   This will create a directory called `googletest-release-1.7.0`.

6. **(Optional) Install lit:**

   For testing the `lit` tool is used. If you LLVM from a build tree you can
   skip this step as the build system will try to use `llvm-lit` in the
   directory containing the LLVM binaries.

   If you don't want to run the tests you can skip this step but you will need
   to pass `-DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=OFF` and `-DENABLE_SYSTEM_TESTS=OFF` to CMake
   when configuring KLEE in step 8.

   ```bash
   $ pip install lit
   ```

8. **Get KLEE source:**  

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/klee/klee.git
   ```

9. **Configure KLEE:**

   KLEE must be built "out of source" so first make a binary build directory. You can create this where ever you like.

   ```bash
   $ mkdir klee_build_dir
   ```

   Now `cd` into the build directory and run CMake to configure KLEE where `<KLEE_SRC_DIRECTORY>` is the path
   to the KLEE git repository you cloned in step 7.

   ```bash
   $ cd klee_build_dir
   $ cmake <CMAKE_OPTIONS> <KLEE_SRC_DIRECTORY>
   ```

   `<CMAKE_OPTIONS>` are the configuration options. These are documented in [README-CMake.md](https://github.com/klee/klee/blob/master/README-CMake.md).

   For example if KLEE was being built with STP, the POSIX runtime, klee-uclibc and testing then the
   command line would look something like this

   ```bash
   cmake \
     -DENABLE_SOLVER_STP=ON \
     -DENABLE_POSIX_RUNTIME=ON \
     -DENABLE_KLEE_UCLIBC=ON \
     -DKLEE_UCLIBC_PATH=<KLEE_UCLIBC_SOURCE_DIR> \
     -DGTEST_SRC_DIR=<GTEST_SOURCE_DIR> \
     -DENABLE_SYSTEM_TESTS=ON \
     -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON \
     -DLLVM_CONFIG_BINARY=<PATH_TO_LLVM38_llvm-config> \
     -DLLVMCC=<PATH_TO_clang-3.8> \
     -DLLVMCXX=<PATH_TO_clang++-3.8>
     <KLEE_SRC_DIRECTORY>
   ```

   Where `<KLEE_UCLIBC_SOURCE_DIR>` is the absolute path the klee-uclibc source tree,
   `<GTEST_SOURCE_DIR>` is the absolute path to the Google Test source tree.


   **NOTE:** If LLVM is not found or you need a particular version to be used you can pass `-DLLVM_CONFIG_BINARY=<LLVM_CONFIG_BINARY>` to CMake where `<LLVM_CONFIG_BINARY>` is the absolute path to the
   relevant `llvm-config` binary. Similarly KLEE needs a C and C++ compiler that can create LLVM bitcode that is compatible with the version of LLVM KLEE is using. If these are not detected automatically `-DLLVMCC=<PATH_TO_CLANG>` and `-DLLVMCXX=<PATH_TO_CLANG++>` can be passed to explicitly set these compilers where `<PATH_TO_CLANG>` is the absolute path to `clang` and `<PATH_TO_CLANG++>` is the absolute path to `clang++`.

   **NOTE II:** By default, KLEE uses tcmalloc as the allocator to support reporting of memory usage above 2GB. If you don't want to install tcmalloc (`libtcmalloc-minimal4 libgoogle-perftools-dev` Ubuntu packages) on your system or prefer to use glibc allocator, pass `-DENABLE_TCMALLOC=OFF` to CMake when configuring KLEE.


9. **Build KLEE:**

   From the ``klee_build_dir`` directory created in the previous step run.

   ```bash
   $ make
   ```

   **NOTE:** If you see linker errors involving `cxx11` you may be running into the [dual ABI issue](https://github.com/klee/klee/issues/336#issuecomment-181827009).
   Here's an example:

   ```
/usr/lib/llvm-3.4/include/llvm/Support/CommandLine.h:905: undefined reference to `vtable for llvm::cl::parser<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > >'
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o: In function `main':
/home/user/programs/klee/klee/tools/kleaver/main.cpp:413: undefined reference to `llvm::error_code::message[abi:cxx11]() const'
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o: In function `llvm::cl::opt<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, false, llvm::cl::parser<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > > >::~opt()':
   ```

   This is caused by a mismatch between the ABI used to build LLVM and the ABI used to build KLEE. To fix this delete your KLEE build directory and rerun `cmake` like so

   ```bash
   $ CXXFLAGS="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" cmake <CMAKE_OPTIONS> <KLEE_SRC_DIRECTORY>
   ```

   <a name="rtti_link_error">**NOTE:**</a> If you see linker errors involving undefined references to `typeinfo` this is likely an [RTTI issue](https://github.com/klee/klee/issues/508).
   Here's an example:

   ```
[ 81%] Linking CXX executable ../../bin/kleaver
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o:(.rodata+0x1238): undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::cl::Option'
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o:(.rodata+0x1270): undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::cl::generic_parser_base'
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o:(.rodata+0x12d0): undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::cl::GenericOptionValue'
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o:(.rodata+0x12f8): undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::cl::Option'
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o:(.rodata+0x1330): undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::cl::generic_parser_base'
CMakeFiles/kleaver.dir/main.cpp.o:(.rodata+0x1390): undefined reference to `typeinfo for llvm::cl::GenericOptionValue'
   ```

   The issue here is that LLVM was built without RTTI but KLEE is trying to build with RTTI. This is caused by the `llvm-config` binary not correctly reporting
   that `-fno-rtti` needs to be passed to the compiler. To fix this delete your KLEE build directory and rerun `cmake` like so

   ```
   $ CXXFLAGS="-fno-rtti" cmake <CMAKE_OPTIONS> <KLEE_SRC_DIRECTORY>
   ```


9. **(Optional) Run the main regression test suite**

   If KLEE was configured with system tests enabled
   then you can run them like this.
   
   ```bash
   $ make systemtests
   ```
   
   If you want to invoke `lit` manually use:

   ```bash
   $ lit test/
   ```
   
   This way you can run individual tests or subsets of the suite:

   ```bash
   $ lit test/regression
   ```
   
9. **(Optional) Build and run the unit tests:**

   If KLEE was configured with unit tests enabled then you can build and run the
   unit tests like this.

   ```bash
   $ make unittests
   ```

9. **You're ready to go! Check the [Tutorials]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials) page to try KLEE.**

**NOTE:** For testing real applications (e.g. Coreutils), you may need to increase your system's open file limit (ulimit -n). Something between 10000 and 999999 should work. In most cases, the hard limit will have to be increased first, so it is best to directly edit the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file.<br/><br/>
