## ktest-tool

KLEE can be configured to output `.ktest` [files]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/files) whenever it finds an error, covers new code or terminates a path.
The content of a `.ktest` file describes the program input that is needed to guide a concrete execution exactly along the corresponding execution path.
Typically, it comprises concrete values for symbolic input files, symbolic arguments, and symbolic variables introduced with `klee_make_symbolic`.
The `ktest-tool` is a Python script that converts the contents of a `.ktest` file into human-readable form.
For instance for the [get_sign.c](https://github.com/klee/klee/blob/f9aa2a3534ac47e07cd1f8b21bafb784b7a0c6c6/examples/get_sign/get_sign.c#L19) example from the KLEE directory it would print a concrete value for the symbolic 32bit integer `a` in different representations (Python byte string, hexadecimal, little-endian uint/int, ...):
```
$ ktest-tool klee-last/test000003.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000003.ktest'
args       : ['get_sign.bc']
num objects: 1
object 0: name: 'a'
object 0: size: 4
object 0: data: b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x80'
object 0: hex : 0x00000080
object 0: int : -2147483648
object 0: uint: 2147483648
object 0: text: ....
```

## klee-stats

_klee-stats_ is a Python script used to extract and present in a tabular form runtime statistics for a KLEE execution. The runtime statistics include:

* The number of executed instructions
* Instruction coverage in the LLVM bitcode (%)
* Branch coverage in the LLVM bitcode (%)
* Total static instructions in the LLVM bitcode
* The number of currently active states
* Megabytes of memory currently used
* The number of queries issued to the SMT solver
* The average number of query constructs per query
* Various time statistics:
  * Total user time
  * Total wall time
  * Time spent in the constraint solver
  * Time spent in the counterexample caching code
  * Time spent forking
  * Time spent in object resolution

_klee-stats_ extracts statistics information from the `run.stats` file present in the `klee-out-*` directory created during a KLEE execution. The exact usage of _klee-stats_ is as follows:

```
klee-stats [options] directories
```

The _directories_ parameter is a list of `klee-out-*` directories created by KLEE. A common scenario is to simply run _klee-stats_ on _klee-last_.

In order to limit printed information only to the values of measured times, the following options can be used:

* `--print-rel-times` display time values relative to measured execution time
* `--print-abs-times` display absolute time values

The `--precision` option can be used to configure the number of fractional digits displayed in floating point values. By default, 2 fractional digits are displayed, but in some cases that might be not sufficientâ€”if the value is very small, e.g. 0.0001, with 2-digits precision it will be printed as 0.00.

Several table styles are supported, e.g. `latex_booktabs` or `html`, and can be enabled with `--table-format=<format>`.

Various other options can be used to specify what values are displayed and how they are displayed. Options for comparison of statistics are also provided. More information about available options can be obtained using the command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ klee-stats --help
{% endhighlight %}


### Conversion to comma-separated values (csv)

Starting with version 2.0, KLEE switched from csv to [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org) to store its statistics.
Of course, these files can be opened and queried with any SQLite client, e.g.:

```
$ sqlite3 <klee-out-dir>/run.stats
> SELECT * FROM stats
```

The easiest way to convert all statistics to comma-separated values (csv) is to use `klee-stats` with `--to-csv` flag.
If the output needs to be modified or limited to specific columns and rows an SQLite client such as `sqlite3` comes handy:

```
$ sqlite3 -csv -header run.stats "select Instructions,printf(\"%.2f\",100.0*CoveredInstructions/(CoveredInstructions+UncoveredInstructions)) AS 'Icov(%)',printf(\"%.2f\",1.0*SolverTime/60000000) AS 'SolverTime(min)',NumQueries from stats ORDER BY WallTime DESC LIMIT 1" 
Instructions,Icov(%),SolverTime(min),NumQueries
2376923,3.96,51.77,514
```


### Live-monitoring with Grafana

`klee-stats` can also be used as a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) data-source. This enables you to
create Grafana dashboards for live monitoring of your KLEE process. First,
`klee-stats` needs to be started with the `-grafana` flag to start serving the
data:

```
klee-stats --grafana <klee-out-dir>
```

Which starts on port 5000 by default. Then you need a Grafana instance with
`simple-json-data-source` plugin enabled. You can start a local one via Docker
with:

```
docker run \
  -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --net=host \
  --name=grafana \
  -e "GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=grafana-clock-panel,grafana-simple-json-datasource" \
  grafana/grafana
```

Which will create a daemon container running Grafana on port 3000. You then need
to add the `klee-stats` data source started above to Grafana.

Go to `localhost:3000` and login with `admin`,`admin` username and password.
Click `Add data source` -> `SimpleJson` and add the HTTP url to point to
`http://localhost:5000` and click `Save and test`. If successful the whole
screen should look like:


[![]({{site.url}}/content/AddDatasource.png){:.wide}]({{site.url}}/content/AddDatasource.png)

Now you are ready to create a Grafana dashboard showing the statistics. Create a
new dashboard by clicking the plus on the side bar and select `Dashboard` and
click `Add Query`:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/AddDashboard.png){:.wide}]({{site.url}}/content/AddDashboard.png)

Finally select the statistic you want to plot as shown below:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/AddStatistic.png){:.wide}]({{site.url}}/content/AddStatistic.png)

You can then of course customize your dashboard, add more panels change time
ranges and enjoy the live monitoring of KLEE


### Logging granularity

The intervals at which KLEE writes its statistics are [configurable]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/options/#statistics).
All times are lower bounds and a long running solver query might prevent KLEE from writing new entries.
