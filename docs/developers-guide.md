## GitHub Environment

KLEE's codebase is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/klee/klee). For those unfamiliar with GitHub, a good starting point is [here](https://help.github.com/categories/54/articles).

We are using a fork & pull model in KLEE, based on pull requests. For those of you unfamiliar with the process, you can find more information [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

### Pull Requests

When making a pull request, please ensure the following:

1. **PR addresses a single issue.** In other words, if some parts of a PR could form another independent PR, you should break this PR into multiple smaller PRs.  This makes it easier to review and approve patches.

2. **There are no unnecessary commits.** For instance, commits that fix issues with a previous commit in this PR are unnecessary and should be removed (you can find documentation on squashing commits [here](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request#squash-your-changes)).

3. **Larger PRs are divided into a logical sequence of commits.** Large PRs are much easier to review if they are broken down into a sequence of commits.

4. **Each commit has a meaningful message documenting what it does.**  The commit message should add as a summary of its changes. Generic commits such as "More work" are obviously unhelpful.

5. **The code is commented.** In particular, newly added classes and functions should be documented. New files should also include the standard KLEE header. 

6. **The patch is formatted via clang-format.** KLEE uses the LLVM style guide, which can be applied via [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). You might also want to use [git-clang-format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llvm/llvm-project/master/clang/tools/clang-format/git-clang-format) for Git integration.
Please only format the patch itself and code surrounding the patch, not entire files.
However, if the patch touches most of the code in a function, or most of the code in a file, it is fine (and recommended) to format the entire file.
Divergences from clang-formatting are only rarely accepted, and only if they clearly improve code readability.

7. **Add test cases exercising the code you added or modified.** We expect system and/or unit test cases for all non-trivial changes. After you submit your PR, you will be able to see a Codecov report telling you which parts of your patch are not covered by the regression test suite.  You will also be able to see if the Github Actions CI and Cirrus CI tests have passed. If they don't, you should examine the failures and address them before the PR can be reviewed.

8. **Spellcheck all messages added to the codebase, all comments, as well as commit messages.**  Make sure all messages added to the code (e.g. error messages, command-line options), all comments, and commit messages are spellchecked.


## Build System

KLEE uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/) as build system. The very basic build
setup similar to what KLEE uses is presented in LLVM's [Writing an LLVM pass
tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html#setting-up-the-build-environment).


LLVM's build system supports out-of-source builds and so does KLEE.  It is
highly recommended you take advantage of this. For example, you could create
three builds (Release, Release with debug symbols, Debug) that all use the same
source tree. This allows you to keep your source tree clean and to build with
multiple configurations from a single source tree.

### Setting up a debug build of KLEE

Setting up a debug build of KLEE (we'll assume it is an out-of-source build) is
very similar to the build process described in [Getting
Started]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started). KLEE uses standard [LLVM build type
idioms](http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#frequently-used-cmake-variables), so
building a Debug build means just setting the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable to
`Debug` for example:

```bash
   cmake \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
     -DENABLE_SOLVER_STP=ON \
     -DENABLE_POSIX_RUNTIME=ON \
     -DKLEE_UCLIBC_PATH=<KLEE_UCLIBC_SOURCE_DIR> \
     -DGTEST_SRC_DIR=<GTEST_SOURCE_DIR> \
     -DENABLE_SYSTEM_TESTS=ON \
     -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON \
     -DLLVM_DIR=<PATH_TO_LLVM_INSTALLATION> \
     -DLLVMCC=<PATH_TO_clang> \
     -DLLVMCXX=<PATH_TO_clang++>
     <KLEE_SRC_DIRECTORY>
```

The rest of the build process is exactly the same as in our build guides. Note
that we only provide build guides for some popular LLVM versions, however KLEE
builds with many more (at the time of writing LLVM 9 - LLVM 14).  The build
process is exactly the same, cmake only needs `LLVM_DIR`,
`LLVMCC` and `LLVMCXX` to point to versions of LLVM you want to build with. 

Note that KLEE depends on LLVM and STP (and optionally Z3). If you need to
debug KLEE's calls to that code, then you will need to build LLVM/STP/Z3 with
debug support as well.

## Source overview

This section gives a brief overview of how KLEE's source code is structured:

* `include/` contains the publicly exported header files. That is header files
  that are accessible throughout the source code.

* `tools/` has the `main` functions for all KLEE binaries in the `bin/`
  directory. Note that some are Python scripts.

* `lib/` contains most of the code.
    * `lib/Core` contains code that interprets and executes the LLVM bitcode and
      KLEE's memory model. The `Executor.cpp` class is usually a good starting
      point for any KLEE extension.
    * `lib/Expr` has KLEE's expression library.
    * `lib/Solver` contains all the solvers (STP, Z3, MetaSMT) as well as all
      the solvers in the solver chain (Independent Solver and Counterexample
      Cache).
    * `lib/Module` deals with manipulating the LLVM bitcode before it is
      executed. It links in the (POSIX) runtime functions, runs
      optimisations and other passes. Some of these put the LLVM bitcode in the state
      KLEE expects and insert some runtime checks (such as instrumenting the
      division operations to check for div by zero errors).

* `runtime/` contains the various runtime KLEE supports. That is code that is
  linked in with the program KLEE analyses before execution.

* `tests/` contains small C programs and LLVM bitcode that is used as a
  regression test suite for KLEE.

### Adding a class

Because KLEE uses LLVM's build system, adding a class to an existing library in
KLEE is very simple. For example, to add a class to libkleaverExpr
(``lib/Expr``), the
following steps would be followed:

1. Create the header file (``.h``) for the class and place it somewhere inside
``include/`` (the location isn't really important except that ``#include`` is
relative to the ``include/`` directory). Note that if you only require the
header in the same directory you can also put it next to the source file (ie.
``lib/Expr/``).

2. Create the source file (``.cpp``) for the class place it in ``lib/Expr/``.

3. Add your ``.cpp`` file to the ``lib/Expr/CMakeLists.txt`` as an argument to
the ``klee_add_component`` function.

That's it! 

### Tracing

KLEE provides macros that aid with tracing or "print debugging".

`KLEE_DEBUG_WITH_TYPE(type, code);` which can be used as follows:

```C
#include "klee/Support/Debug.h"
...
KLEE_DEBUG_WITH_TYPE("my-feature",
  llvm::errs() << "Currently there are " << states.size() << "states\n";
);
```

This code will be a noop unless `-debug-only=my-feature` flag is passed to KLEE, for example
`klee -debug-only=my-feature myprog.bc`. Multiple types can be passed in a comma separated list: `-debug-only=my-feature1,my-feature2`.



### Building code documentation

KLEE uses [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) to generate code documentation. To generate it yourself you can run the following from KLEE's build directory root.

{% highlight bash %}
$ make docs
{% endhighlight %}

This will generate the documentation in `path/to/build-dir/docs/doxygen/`.

## Regression Testing Framework

KLEE uses LLVM's testing infrastructure for its regression tests. In KLEE these are...

* External tests executed by [lit](http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html). These are the tests that are executed by the ``make check`` command. These test the KLEE tools externally.
* Internal tests that are driven using [GoogleTest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/). These are the tests that are executed by the ``make unittests`` command.  These test KLEE's internal APIs.

### External tests

``lit`` is used to test KLEE's tools by invoking them as shell commands.

KLEE's tests are currently divided into categories, each of which is a subdirectory in ``test/`` in the source tree (e.g. ``test/Feature``).

``lit`` is passed one or more paths to test files or directories which it will search recursively for tests. The ``lit`` tool needs to know what test-suite the tests belong to and how to run them. This information is in the ``lit.site.cfg`` (generated by the ``Makefile``). This file itself refers to ``lit.cfg`` which tells ``lit`` how to run the test suite. At the time of writing the ``lit.cfg`` instructs ``lit`` to treat files with the following file extensions as tests:`` .ll .c .cpp .kquery``.

It is desirable to disable some tests (e.g. disable klee-uclibc tests if support was not compiled in) or change which file extensions to look for. This is done by adding a ``lit.local.cfg`` file to a directory which can be used to customise how tests in that directory are executed. For example to change the file extensions searched for to ``.cxx`` and ``.txt`` the following could be used in a ``lit.local.cfg`` file:

{% highlight python %}
config.suffixes = ['.cxx', '.txt' ]
{% endhighlight %}

To disable execution of tests in a directory based on a condition you can
mark them as unsupported by placing the following inside a
``lit.local.cfg`` file in that directory (where ``some_condition`` is any Python expression):

{% highlight python %}
if some_condition:  config.unsupported = True
{% endhighlight %}

All ``lit`` configuration files are Python scripts loaded by ``lit`` so you have the full power of Python at your disposal.

The actions performed in each test are specified by special comments in the file. For example, in ``test/Feature/ByteSwap.c`` the first two lines are:

{% highlight c %}
// RUN: %clang %s -emit-llvm %O0opt -c -o %t1.bc
// RUN: %klee --libc=klee --exit-on-error %t1.bc
{% endhighlight %}

This first runs ``clang`` on the source file (``%s``) and generates a temporary file (``%t1.bc``). Then, KLEE symbolically executes this bitcode file with one of its runtimes (here ``--libc=klee``). If either program returns a non-zero exit code (or crashes), the test is considered to have failed. More information on the available substitution variables (such as ``%s``) can be found [here](http://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#variables-and-substitutions).

For LLVM versions greater than 5.0 programs that are to be analysed with KLEE
should not be compiled with `-O0`, since it disables KLEE's ability to run
optimisation passes. Therefore, we have the `%O0opt` variable, which
substitutes to appropriate flags. At the time of writing these are: `-O0
-Xclang -disable-O0-optnone`. For more details see this
[issue](https://github.com/klee/klee/issues/902). 

To run the entire test suite run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd path/to/klee/build/test
$ make check
{% endhighlight %}

or you can use ``lit`` directly

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd path/to/klee/build/test
$ lit .
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to run a subset of the test suite simply pass the filenames of the tests or directories to search for tests to ``lit``. For example the commands below will execute the ``Feature/DoubleFree.c`` and ``CXX/ArrayNew.cpp`` test and all tests nested in the ``regression/`` folder.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd path/to/klee/build/test
$ lit Feature/DoubleFree.c CXX/ArrayNew.cpp  regression/
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes it can be useful to pass extra command line options to ``klee`` or ``kleaver`` when running tests. This could be used for example to quickly see if changing the default value for a command line option changes the passing/failing of a test. This is **not** a substitute for writing new tests for ``klee`` or ``kleaver``! If you add a new feature that is exposed by a new command line option a new test should be added that tests this behaviour.

Here is an example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd test/
$ lit --param klee_opts=-use-forked-solver=0 --param kleaver_opts="-use-forked-solver=0 -use-query-log=all:smt2" .
{% endhighlight %}

In this example when running ``klee`` in tests an extra option ``-use-forked-solver=0`` is passed to ``klee`` and when running ``kleaver`` the ``-use-forked-solver=0`` and ``-use-query-log=all:smt2`` options will be passed to ``kleaver``. It is important to realise if the test already invokes ``klee`` or ``kleaver`` with a particular option you will not be able to override that option because the ``klee_opts`` and ``kleaver_opts`` are substituted just after the tool name so subsequent options used in the test will override these.

For more information on ``lit`` tests see [LLVM's testing infrastructure documentation](http://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#id1) and the [``lit`` tool documentation](http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html).

### Internal tests

These tests are located in ``unittests/`` and can be executed by running:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cd path/to/klee/build
$ make unittests
{% endhighlight %}

These test use [Google's C++ testing framework](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) and is well [documented](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Documentation).

## Run-time libraries

KLEE provides a set of different run-time libraries that can be selected to augment the software under test. To support this, runtime libraries are meant to be independent of the actual architecture KLEE is running on.
Therefore, when KLEE is built, a set of differently configured runtime libraries is built as well.
Currently, every combination of the supported architectures (32bit x86, 64bit x86) and different optimisations: `Release`, `Release+Debug`, `Release+Debug+Asserts`, `Debug+Asserts`, and `Debug` is pre-built.

These pre-built libraries can be found in the build directory (`build/runtime/lib`) and have the following pattern: `libklee`+`MyLibrary`+`architecture`+`optimisation`+`.bca`.

During runtime, KLEE detects for which platform the software under test was compiled and the user can select the level of optimisation to link with and override the default with `klee --runtime-build=Release+Debug`. During startup, KLEE links against this specific setup.

### Adding new run-time libraries

To add a new library (e.g, `MyLibrary`), place the directory containing the library below the `runtime/` directory, e.g. `runtime/MyLibrary`.

Add the following code to `runtime/CMakeLists.txt` to make CMake aware of additional subdirectories:
```
add_subdirectory(MyLibrary)
```

and add the same library to the list of `RUNTIME_LIBRARIES`, i.e.:
`list(APPEND RUNTIME_LIBRARIES MyLibrary)`

Add a file `CMakeLists.txt` to `runtime/MyLibrary` that follows a similar structure as `CMakeLists.txt` in other sub-directories of `runtime/MyLibrary`, e.g.:

* set `LIB_PREFIX` to the name of your library:
  ```
  set(LIB_PREFIX "MyLibrary")
  ```

* set `SRC_FILES` to all `.c` or `.cpp` files that are part of this library

* set additional flags, if needed, as arguments of the  `add_bitcode_library_targets` function call

### Add new architectures

Modify `runtime/CMakeLists.txt` to add a new architecture at `bc_architecture` and add specific compiler flags int the following `foreach` loop.

Modify `tools/klee/main.cpp` to add appropriate architecture detection as well.

### Add new optimizations

Fancy a new way the provided runtime libraries should be pre-compiled (e.g., `MyFancyOptimization`)?

Add the name for the new optimization at the beginning of `runtime/CMakeLists.txt`:

```
list(APPEND available_klee_runtime_build_types MyFancyOptimization)
```

And add the specific optimization inside of the `foreach` loop at the beginning of the file:

```
elseif (bc_optimization STREQUAL "MyFancyOptimization")
            list(APPEND local_flags -O42 -g)
```

### External bitcode libraries: `uclibc`, `libc++`

KLEE utilizes bitcode libraries that are not generating while compiling KLEE, e.g. `libc++` or `uclibc`.
KLEE searches for run-time libraries in install and build paths. These are hard-coded to the binary, so if the filesystem tree changes, KLEE will not find them until recompiled. This behaviour can be overridden by setting KLEE_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the path to the libraries.


## Miscellaneous

### Writing messages to standard error

The kleeCore library (`lib/Core`) provides several functions that can be used similarly to `printf()` in C. See `include/klee/Support/ErrorHandling.h` for more information.

### Adding a command line option to a tool

KLEE uses LLVM's CommandLine library for adding options to tools in KLEE, which is well documented [here](http://llvm.org/docs/CommandLine.html). See ``lib/Core/Executor.cpp`` for examples.
