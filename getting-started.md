There are three ways to get started with KLEE.

* [Use our Docker images]({{site.baseurl}}/docker): this is the fastest way to get started.
* [Build from source against LLVM 3.4]({{site.baseurl}}/build-llvm34): this is the current recommended version.
* [Build from source against LLVM 2.9]({{site.baseurl}}/build-llvm29): this is another version which we are still maintaining.
