* [Build from source against LLVM 9]({{site.baseurl}}/build-llvm9): this is the currently recommended version
* [Build from source against LLVM 3.8]({{site.baseurl}}/build-llvm38): this version of LLVM is the earliest non-deprecated version supported by KLEE
* [FreeBSD package](https://www.freshports.org/security/klee): FreeBSD users can install latest release with `pkg install klee` or by building `security/klee` port themselves.
* [Homebrew package]({{site.baseurl}}/install-brew): install the latest release using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
