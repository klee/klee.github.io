There are multiple ways to get started with KLEE.

* [KLEE web](http://klee.doc.ic.ac.uk/): run tiny code examples in your browser
* [Our Docker images]({{site.baseurl}}/docker): this is the fastest way to get started.
* [Build from source against LLVM 6.0]({{site.baseurl}}/build-llvm60): this is the currently recommended version
* [Build from source against LLVM 3.8]({{site.baseurl}}/build-llvm38): this version of LLVM is the earliest non-deprecated version supported by KLEE
